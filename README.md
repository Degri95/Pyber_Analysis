# Pyber_Analysis
Analyzing rideshare data with python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, and matplotlib

## Overview
 In this analysis we'll get driver and fare metrics for the ride-share company PyBer, and create visualizations of the data for the CEO of the company. After the data has been extracted, we'll compare the metrics of the three city types PyBer operates in. 

 - Urban
 - Suburban
 - Rural
 
## Results
First, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
